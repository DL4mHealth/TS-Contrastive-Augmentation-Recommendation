Self-supervised contrastive learning is a significant framework in time series analysis, utilizing meaningful representations learned without explicit labels. Augmentation plays a crucial role, with **performance variations up to 30%** based on the choice of augmentation, typically chosen through empirical methods or time-consuming grid searches. Here, we provide guidelines to select augmentations aligned with dataset characteristics like trend and seasonality. We generated 12 synthetic datasets with varying trend, seasonality, and integration weights and tested the effectiveness of 8 different augmentations. We further validated our findings across 6 real-world datasets from various domains—activity recognition, disease diagnosis, traffic monitoring, electricity usage, mechanical fault prognosis, and finance—featuring diverse characteristics. Our **trend-seasonality-based augmentation recommendation method (ts-arm)**, the TS represents both Time Series and Trend Seasonality, significantly outperforms baselines, achieving an average Recall@3 of 0.734, providing a robust method for augmentation selection in contrastive learning for time series analysis.

Here is our simplified workflow:

## Key contributions of this work
- We construct 12 synthetic time series datasets that cover linear and non-linear trends, trigonometric and wavelet-based seasonalities, and three types of weighted integration.
- We assess the effectiveness of 8 commonly used augmentations across all synthetic datasets, thereby elucidating the relationships between time series properties and the effectiveness of specific augmentations.
- We propose a trend-seasonality-based framework that precisely recommends the most suitable augmentations for a given time series dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our recommendations significantly outperform those based on popularity and random selection.

## Recommendation Results
*E.g., Recall@3 = 0.667 = 2/3 means that: 2 out of 3 recommended augmentations fall within the true 3 best augmentations.* 

| Recommendation method |Recall | HAR | PTB | FD | ElecD | SPX500 | Mean |

|        | Recall@2 | 0.235 | 0.217 | 0.222 | 0.218 | 0.209 | 0.22 |
|        | Recall@3 | 0.335 | 0.331 | 0.336 | 0.339 | 0.331 | 0.334 |
| Popularity | Recall@1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.2 |
|            | Recall@2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0.5 | 0 | 0.3 |
|            | Recall@3 | 0.667 | 0.333 | 0.667 | 0.667 | 0.667 | 0.6 |

|                               | Recall@2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0.5 | 0.7 |

## Installation
To install the **T**ime **S**eries Contrastive **A**ugmentation **R**ecommendation **M**ethod (TS_ARM) tool: 

```bash
pip install ts_arm
```

The TS_ARM tool is lightweight and has a minimal dependency on external packages:
```
numpy, scikit_learn, scipy, statsmodels, tqdm
```

## Usage
For instance, when working with the **FD dataset** to obtain **top 3** effective augmentations for building contrastive pairs in a time series classification task:
```
from ts_arm import aug_rec
import numpy as np

queryset = np.load("FD_trainx.npy")  # training features of your query dataset
FD_top_augs = aug_rec.aug_rec_ts(queryset_name='FD',
                          K=3,  # number of Augmentations you want to have
                          query_length=1280,  # feature length in query dataset
                          query_period_list=[40],  # list of potential periods, here we only take 40 as an example
                          queryset=queryset)
```
⚠️ **Note:** For some datasets, the first step, STL decomposition, may take a considerable amount of time.

The primary output will be the top three augmentations for your query dataset (the last line, displayed in bold and green, which may not appear correctly in GitHub's rendered view).  
Additionally, the output includes supplementary information related to the calculations of key steps in our trend-seasonality-based recommendation methods, which can be useful if you need to understand the details of the process.

```
In addition, if you want to check the popularity-based recommendation baseline:
```
FD_augs_popular = aug_rec.aug_rec_popular(3)
```
The output:
```
Popularity-based top 3 recommendation: ['Jittering', 'TimeMasking', 'Resizing']
```
